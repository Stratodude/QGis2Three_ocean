# QGis2Three_ocean

![example_img](/ex.png)

<a href="https://github.com/minorua/Qgis2threejs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qgis2threejs</a> is an amazing QGIS plugin allowing us to create a Threejs 3D project with our GIS data whithout having to deal with any code.

I've used it a lot of time and was frustrated because a couldn't add features as a Skybox, water layer or clouds. So I decided to dive into the code to make some slight changes allowing it.

It's still in progress but i'm seeing encouraging results. One of the major improvment we can make is probably around rendering efficienty, and as always any proposition would be a precious help.
